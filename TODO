High priority (have to finish before competition)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Medium priority:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Add 'look around' mode -- one key turret movement in large increments
   (every 30 degrees on 'x' axis) -- so one can spot enemies easier

 * Poll fire motor status more often when shooting

 * Log stdout/stderr of external processes of vserver

 * Make turret servoes stronger: replace horn

 * Better logging: send server status packets more often when times are
   interesting (moving, shooting)

 * Add a zoom option to simplify long-distance (10ft) shooting

 * Add a plug for BB container so they do not roll out when robot stands up

 * One-click shooting: 'cont' mode (shoot while mouse button is held)

 * Properly estimate number of shots when commands overlap (for 'cont' mode)

 * Shoot qualification video and post it.
   2013 rules say: 5 minutes of motion, 4 plastic cups 8-12'' from the ground.

 * Make video more error-resistant. Decrease I-frame interval? (this might
   require getting uvch264src to work)

 * power-off/reboot all servoes when client goes away

 * Model turret
  - Center of coordinates is camera center
  - Laser has offset (cm, Y only, X=0), and roll/pitch errors
  - Gun has offset (cm, Y only, X=0) and roll/pitch errors
   - Possibly also has bullet speed correction
  - Should allow calibration; should show laser point and hit points
  - Requires knowledge of distance to target:
   - MVP: mouse wheel changes distance; align laser marker with laser spot,
     then gun marker shows where bullets would hit
   - Add vision-based distance to detect laser spot

 * Add accelerometer support.
  - It run it as standalone C helper, as it takes 100% of CPU's one core
  - Need to start/stop it as needed (only when user connects)
  - Need to parse its stdout in a meaningful way.

 * Use accelerometer to detect # of shots fired.

 * Use accelerometer to try detect mis-shots: known we are out of ammo,
   auto-retry on misshots

 * Fix problem of SSH KEX failing: either add reboot option to
   vserver_launcher, or install ethersafe.

Lower priority:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * UI: Synchronize server status OSD with video
  - server should include current video ts in the stream
   - this required something other then gst-launch that we currently use
  - client's OSD display should delay status frames until video timestamp
    is received.

 * UI: add mechanism to update OSD when video frames are not coming in

 * UI: do not always restart vserver on vclient start

 * Consider: record OSD into final video (as subtitles or re-code video
   properly)
   - vlc supports "vobsub" format -- external subtitles with text index
     and RLE-compressed images in underdocumented format.
   - vobsub may be embedded into mkv:
     http://matroska.org/technical/specs/subtitles/images.html
   - 'sub2vobsub.c' is the minimal vobsub creator
     http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=111664 (describes .c bugs)

 * Fix bug where the playback speed of record mkv's is too high (only present
   in old mlplayer???)

 * Make turret servoes stronger: add extra bearings

 * Add a way to reset all servoes without restarting app (for example,
   after power fault). This should also re-initialize turret servoes.

 * Use accelerometer to determine if agitator is running or not

 * Add high-PWM mode for agitator (probably only momentary) -- it got stuck once

Software and gait TODOs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

___ legtool ___

 * idle gait improvements either
   * make ripple (and other subsequent gaits) have a specific mode or command
     for entering the idle state
     *the current gait architecture has no method for reporting "done"
   * make a new "idle" gait, which knows how to pick up each leg and move the
     body into the idle position
     * how you get into idle, at least from the ripple gait, should really
       depend upon the ripple parameters, like whether you are being
       statically stable or not, and which legs are moving in pairs
     * it is unclear how you could even do a statically stable gait here
       without replicating all the logic from ripple
 * when accepting a new command, see how much time would elapse before any of
   the existing stance legs would become unreachable.  if this is before they
   are scheduled to be swing, slow down the command to give them time to lift

___ foot transducer ___

 * test vertical mold in vacuum
 * update firmware to use ttl serial bus
 * maybe try a differential signaling scheme for firmware (test at higher data
   rates or increased noise)

___ IMU ___

 * GaitDriver
   * create a new top level program not in legtool which uses the linux_input
     stuff for joystick and which has a new gait type:
   * Implement second gait type which just lifts two legs up in the air (later
     to be the balancing gait)
 * figure out how to structure code so that IMU can be exposed from gazebo, or
   the real IMU, while remaining separate from legtool
 * measure noise performance of MiniIMUv3
 * simulate IMU in gazebo
 * implement 2 leg balancing and static 2 leg gaits in gazebo

___ Improve legtool ____
 * refactor mafanasyev's random mjmech specific legtool changes out
 * figure out how to use foot pressure indication
 * move all servos doesn't update sliders
 * new tab to test different gaits over different regimes
 * render achievable leg positions in geometry view
 * gait graph could be generated from output states, without having to have
   custom code to generate it
 * make rendering achievable commands not be so crazy slow
 * stable gait
   * _select_command_options needs to somehow be made aware of the statically
     stable gait so that it selects options which result in achievable leg
     positions no matter the position margin

 * UI: Show bullet count (approx.)
 * Better logging: log client-side messages

DONE 2015-03-04:
 * Tried to change .svg file generation to make entries more readable. Have
   a patch which blurs the background -- great effect, but too high of a CPU
   usage

DONE 2015-03-03:
 * Add clear plastic cover above odroid
 * UI: Hide debug-priority messages from OSD (leave on stdout), demote some
   messages to stdout
 * Added skeleton for i2c poller (for accelerometer support)

DONE 2015-03-02:
 * UI: fix reticle #1 to use proper display mapping, calibration.
 * Restart servoes when server restarts (instead of just powering down)
 * Log server statuses, including errors

DONE 2015-03-01:
 * UI: One-click shooting -- should shoot once both servoes report INPOSITION
  - shoots on right button click once it is enabled
 * UI: Inactivity timer -- shows contigious time spent not moving


DONE 2015-02-24:
 * UI: Post-click motion
   - When you click, if you hold the mouse and shift it, it slightly tweaks
     gun positions
   - Esp. great with one-click shooting

 * did a first pass at tuning gaits on the real robot
 * made servo communications more robust over tcp

DONE 2014-10-02
 * understood why my experiments at compensating for a gyro going over-rate
   were failing... the quaternion representation just cannot accurately
   represent large covariances, as after quaternion normalization, adjustments
   beyond 1.0 just peter out.  The only way to get more rapid convergence is
   to temporarily increase the attitude process noise, after which arbitrarily
   fast convergence can be had!

   #2 hole size, #4 hole size doesn't leave enough material to be structural
 * Ordered the slightly more expensive wire with a tiny bit smaller diameter
   that is at least somewhat likely to be able to fit 6 wires in a #2 size
   hole
 * Continued working on getting a full attitude filter working, there is some
   problem on the high rotation rate cases, that doesn't seem to crop up with
   other acceleration is happening too

DONE 2014-09-02
 * C++ version speed compares well, 1d is much faster than real time on my
   desktop

DONE 2014-09-01
 * analyze what the process and measurement noises should be for gyros and
   accelerometers with noise model


DONE 2014-08-30
 * practiced threading posts, not very easy with just a vice
 * ordered a collet and more posts to get more practice
 * quoted a custom machined part at emachineshop, basically a $100 setup fee,
   after which parts are $3-5 each.  wouldn't make sense until the design was

 * updated ripple_gait to allow command changes at any time

DONE 2014-06-26
 * got very basic standalone driving application working

DONE 2014-06-11
 * fixed: when stopping playback, the idle pose is not reliably commanded.
   possibly due to the same cause, dragging the mouse around the commander
   with body coordinates does not result in smooth motion
 * after adding better logging to temperature loop, identified that it was an
   assertion failure somewhere, but it hasn't happened again to show which one

DONE 2014-06-10
 * pushed to github and gitlab pygazebo and mtool versions which at least
   mostly work running on trollius, there are still a few outstanding bugs in
   mtool though

DONE 2014-06-06
 * continued work on moving pygazebo and herkulex.py to asyncio.  Have
   pygazebo all converted, but need to fill in some test coverage and verify
   it works actually commanding things

DONE 2014-06-02
 * got amble gaits (and other random leg groupings) working... they work much
   better without trying to be statically stable, which isn't possible on a
   quad anyways

DONE 2014-06-01
 * need to be able to set max and min on a per-servo basis, without having to
   worry about accidentally putting it into an infeasible configuration

 * made gait tab geometry view have square aspect ratio
 * made mtool resizing work better
 * it would be nice if the body commands could be set without waiting for a
   gait transition even if nothing else could be

DONE 2014-05-17
 * Finished cutting prototype polycarb chassis plates

DONE 2014-05-09
 * continued work towards letting the gait tab drive actual servos... mostly
   threading configurations through and cleaning things up
 * fixed some residual broken-ness in the servo and ik tabs from re-factoring
 * fixed link between leg config and the ik tester in the ik tab

DONE 2014-05-07

 * generate the actions list on construction, since commands can now not
   change it
 * rendered the support polygon

DONE 2014-05-05
 * Fixed up the rendering of allowable gaits to be a little more responsive
   and not be obviously incorrect.
 * Added axes and grid to the geometry view, to verify that yes, the gaits
   aren't coming out quite right

DONE 2014-04-29
 * implemented adjusting cycle time and downscaling the command to stay in the
   achievable regime

DONE 2014-04-28
 * redefine IK coordinate system so that it is the same for all legs as viewed

   and swing timing with speed

DONE 2014-04-27
 * Started work to verify that a given command is feasible

DONE 2014-04-26
 * Fixed some bugs and started writing a more comprehensive set of tests for
   gait generation

   looking from the top it looks like it is working!

DONE 2014-04-20
 * Implemented rendering the body, shoulder, and leg positions with no
   niceties (fixed scale, projection, and coordinate frame)
 * Started work on the basic gait generation

DONE 2014-04-14
 * Implemented python "tf" library, to be used in gait tab.

DONE 2014-04-13
 * Continued very slow progress on gait tab of mtool, rendered gait graph.

DONE 2014-04-09

 * Started prototyping rough draft of python gait generator... really just
   what the APIs should look like, no real functionality has been written yet

DONE 2014-04-08

 * Started prototyping interface in designer for the gait tool, I think I have
   all or most of the interface elements I want in there, but I'm not yet sure
   how feasible it will be to implement

DONE 2014-04-06

 * Read the last 5 years of posts on the Trossen Robotics forum, trying to
   figure out what the state of the art in gait generation was.  Yikes, it
   looks like NUKE is largely it.  A number of other people have done one-off
   custom open loop controls, and stag is still the only one I could find
   doing anything closed-loop-ish with a dynamic gait.  It doesn't look like
   anyone actually knows how to measure attitude in a robust way using an
   accel/gyro.

 * mtool
 *  * mtool needs to support multiple configuration files
 *  * mtool needs to document what "idle" is

DONE 2014-04-01
 * Added mounting tabs to all servos
 * add mounting holes for each of the boards
 * add supporting standoffs between the two chassis plates
 * add plate to velcro battery to
 * figure out where the center of mass is going to be, try to get it as close
   to centered as possible (will allow dynamic gaits)
 * make more decorative cutouts on the top plate

DONE 2014-03-30
 * Designed rough draft of chassis plates
 * Created center of mass spreadsheet, flipped turret around to get it close to centered

 * muzzle velocity measured by hitting an aluminum plate and recording with
   audacity... appears to be around 80ft/s with the 0.2g BBs I have

 * considering demo application complete

DONE 2014-03-25

 * Implemented ukf_filter from the book with inspiration from the pykalman
   API, seems much more stable, in that it works as I expect instead of
   exploding randomly

 * Found another bug that was causing IMU readings to stop and fixed it

DONE 2014-03-24

 * Fixed the worst of the UKF problems, but pykalman seems to be not very
   numerically robust in general... will probably write one from the book in
   the end

 * Got the servos to be stable by turning down the D term of their internal PID

 * Made USB not block on transmit

DONE 2014-03-23

 * Integrated gyros into attitude with a 1s bias sampling period at the start,
   works OK, but drift is too large after a minute or so of operation, will
   need ongoing corrections or longer bias sampling period

 * Switched joystick to be accumulative with deadband, and made the d-pad
   adjust in the smallest steps the servo can represent

 * Started work on KF for attitude... having problems that I haven't
   successfully debugged yet

DONE 2014-03-22

 * Traced AVR watchdogs to USB slowness, looks like current USB implementation
   can block for >15ms at a time.  With watchdog set much larger, everything
   works fine.  Will re-work usb_serial.c to not block.

DONE 2014-03-21
 * Wired up servos to AVR and battery through power distribution board
 * Updated AVR to get basic serial communication working

 * Started drafting chassis layout

DONE 2014-03-14

 * Wrote simple application to control turret, laser, agitator, and AEG from

 * Tested at 10ft with the 3'' target... it is plenty feasible to center the
   laser pointer on the target at that distance using nothing but the 1080p
   video feed.  I haven't tested to see how much recoil is caused by the AEG
   mechanism yet (too loud to test much while Cyrus is sleeping)

DONE 2014-03-13
 * installed camera using aluminum jaws
 * wired up laser all the way to AVR on breadboard, tested control in firmware
 * installed EC3 connectors on battery, charger, and motor driver
