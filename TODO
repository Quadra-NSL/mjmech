 * Re-measure where AEG mounting holes are
 * Iterate on AEG mounting plates
   * fix camera geometry, both top and bottom surfaces are sloped
     somewhat
   * get servo holes to be fixed distance away from plate
   * ensure that AEG mounting holes line up
   * see if anything looks nice which shrouds the agitator motor
   * make corners rounded
   * put holes for spacer supports
   * move plates to be 30mm apart
   * switch plates to aluminum thickness
   * re-draw camera jaw, include spacer support holes
   * determine if there is room for M2 washers between plate and servo
     bracket
    

 * Design chassis plate

 * Order full complement of servos
 * Build power distribution board

 * Simulate herkuleX serial protocol

 * Model turret

DONE 2014-03-02
 * First rough draft of turret freecad model

DONE 2014-03-01
 * Fired AEG from lipo with motor driver

DONE 2014-02-20
 * Integrated eventlet with QT in a hacky way
 * Started building simple GUI to drive servos and show IK

DONE 2014-02-18
 * Characterized DRS-0101 servo
 * Assembled mock leg with brackets
 * Ordered rubber bumper cushion for leg tip from McMcaster

DONE 2014-02-16
 * Test fired AEG from lab supply
   * Needed 4.5A before it would run... worked just fine at 5V, higher
     input voltage would probably need PWM
   * Ordered pololu motor driver

DONE 2014-02-15
 * Simulate herkuleX servo physical characteristics
 * Get physics to be more realistic
   * the contact point on the mech's legs may be better represented as
     a sphere?
   * Figure out what the moments of inertia should likely be for what
     we're talking about
 * Ordered test battery
 * Wrote up work plan

DONE 2014-02-14
 * Get NUKE and pypose to operate the thing with oracular commands
   * add subscription support
   * make pypose gazebo driver read other commands and report those as
     current pose

DONE 2014-02-02
 * Switch gazebo_client to using eventlet Event instead of sleeps for
   cross-coroutine synchronization

DONE 2014-02-01
 * Most of the physics problem was that rotational inertia needs to be
   separate specified, as it defaults to something large and independent
   of the mass you chose.
