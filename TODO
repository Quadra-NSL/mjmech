 * Simulate herkuleX servo physical characteristics
 * Simulate herkuleX serial protocol

 * Get physics to be more realistic
   * the contact point on the mech's legs may be better represented as
     a sphere?
   * Figure out what the moments of inertia should likely be for what
     we're talking about

 * Model turret

DONE 2014-02-14
 * Get NUKE and pypose to operate the thing with oracular commands
   * add subscription support
   * make pypose gazebo driver read other commands and report those as
     current pose

DONE 2014-02-02
 * Switch gazebo_client to using eventlet Event instead of sleeps for
   cross-coroutine synchronization

DONE 2014-02-01
 * Most of the physics problem was that rotational inertia needs to be
   separate specified, as it defaults to something large and independent
   of the mass you chose.
