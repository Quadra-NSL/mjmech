The absolute attitude performance is effective the maximum of the
performance due to the accelerometer and the performance due to the
gyroscope.

Accelerometer
-------------

How the accelerometer noise model affects attitude accuracy.

The absolute attitude accuracy is determined by the actual
accelerometer noise divided by the filter's accelerometer measurement
noise.

Assuming a max21000 level gyro (3e-5 ARW 1e-5 bias) and a miniimuv2
level accel (1.9e-2 white noise, 1.2e-3 stability)

accel_meas  accuracy
0.01        0.09
0.1         0.06
1           0.04
10          0.02

The unfiltered noise accuracy of this accelerometer when stationary
and sampled at 100Hz, would be approximately:

degrees((sqrt(100.0) * 1.9e-2) / 9.81) ~= 1.11 deg

I'm not entirely sure why this equals the accuracy numbers in the
above table.  I'm not 100% sure how noise in accelerometer will
propagate into RMS pitch error in a closed form manner.



Gyroscope
---------


Assuming a miniimu v2 level accel, the following gyro accuracies
correspond to the following overall accuracies.

1e-5/3e-5  = 0.03 degree    (bias process 0.0128/sqrt(s))
1e-4/3e-4  = 0.08 degree    (bias process 0.0512/sqrt(s))
1e-3/3e-3  = 0.16 degree    (bias process 0.8192/sqrt(s), pitch_process=3.3deg/s)
