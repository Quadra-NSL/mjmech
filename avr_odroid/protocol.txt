The device shares the serial bus with herculex, so the protocol
is fulley herculex compatible.

AVR listens at 115200 (divisor 16 in high-speed mode, 2.1% error)

It does not handle broadcasts because this it too much pain.

The device sits on address 99, and supports the following commands:
  CMD_STAT
  CMD_REBOOT -- does not reboot, just clears outputs and error flags.
  CMD_RAMWRITE/CMD_RAMREAD -- limited addresses
    - read address and status
    - read/write LEDS (53):
      GREEN is mixer output
      RED   is laser output
      BLUE  is blue LED on the board
      unlike real servo, if no LED commands are given for few 
      seconds, all LEDs are turned off
    - read/write FIRE CONTROL (77, reserved)
      This is 1-byte register which can be read and written.
      As long as it is non-zero:
       - Fire motor is enbled
       - Value decreases by 1 every 10 mS
