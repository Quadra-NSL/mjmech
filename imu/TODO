 * Be able to plot covariances in a usable way
 * Try stationary tests that aren't exactly level and see if all three
   gyros can get good bias estimates
   * figure out why angled tests don't result in lower effective yaw
     rates?
 * Extract out a standalone test for:
   * gyro rate exceeded with ideal IMU for each filter
     * after a limited amount of time being stationary, the attitude
       should be within some bounds
   * stationary performance for each IMU and each filter
     * Verify that yaw rate goes to zero in attitude filter
 * Try to disable memory location in Eigen

Open Questions
 * For my tests, do I want to allow different constants for the
   different IMU categories?
   * I think probably not, because otherwise the number of constants
     to tune will explode, and I really only care about one type of IMU
     at a time.


Random / Old:
 * Make unit tests which verify performance parameters for a given IMU
   configuration.
   * IMU configuration should include:
     * MiniIMUv2, MAX21000
     * At least the minimum and maximum gyro scale factors
     * All can be at max accel scale
   * tests over multiple random seeds
 * Test saturating the gyro sensors
 * Test saturating the accelerometer sensors
