 * Make unit tests which verify performance parameters for a given IMU
   configuration.
   * IMU configuration should include:
     * MiniIMUv2, MAX21000
     * At least the minimum and maximum gyro scale factors
     * All can be at max accel scale
   * tests over multiple random seeds
 * Test saturating the gyro sensors
 * Test saturating the accelerometer sensors
