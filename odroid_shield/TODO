 * bottom chassis plate interferes with bottom USB connector on odroid

   * do schematic ERC
   * line up all connectors
   * try to line up other parts as best I can
   * ensure connectors have sufficient clearance around top plate
   * make ground plane
   * decide on other power planes
     * 8V and 5V are the likely candidates
   * route 5V buck
   * route weapon drive
   * route power
   * autoroute
   * ensure leadless parts have moderately accessible test points for
     all pins
   * pick part numbers for everything (including macrofab numbers)
   * do design DRC
   * label individual pins on headers
   * fix up silks


 * odroid shield for mech
   * accessible from top
     * 2x4 0.1" header for aeg/agitator/laser
     * USB for camera
     * master power switch
     * weapon power switch
     * blinking weapon power light
     * 5V power light
     * shore power connector
     * 12V power for gimbal
     * data for gimbal
     * I2C connector
   * power distribution
     * input connector/pins for battery
     * high current fuse
     * shore power connector for odroid
       * DPN: CP-034A-ND
   * 5V buck regulator for odroid
     * ST1S10  DPN: 497-6904-1-ND
   * 12V boost for gimbal controller
     * MIC2253 DPN: 576-3643-6-ND
   * servo power/data connectors for legs
   * AEG motor driver - MC33926
   * agitator motor driver - MC33926
   * laser control - FET
   * I2C level shift
   * Serial level shift
   * AVR - on I2C bus (or probably serial like we have now)
   * switches
      * CKN5001-ND
      * power
      * weapon
   * power light
   * weapon light
   * some connection for scoring transponder data... maybe just
     another herkulex bus connector?

DONE 2015-06-28
 * Gave useful names to all ICs

DONE 2015-06-27
 * AVR crystal
 * Switch servo connectors to something SMT so that it doesn't eat
   up so much of both sides of the board
   * I guess JST XH
 * Switched fuse to SMT
 * Decided not to bother with 12V up converter for now.  If I build a
   custom gimbal board, I can put it on there.
 * Decided not to mess with custom gimbal controller.
 * IMU - MAX21000 + MMA8451Q
