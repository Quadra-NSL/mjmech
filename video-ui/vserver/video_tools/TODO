both:
 - more unified output format
 - log parsing for python apps
 - latency tracker via packet checksums

sender:
 - run from vserver (in parallel to send_video.sh -- client should be able to choose)
 - command line option to change image resolution (and probably framerate?)
 - opencv adapter, simple image parsing

client:
 - figure out how to set default window size (raw XResizeWindow sometime?)
 - send GST_TAG_TITLE to set more interesting window title
 - maybe use 'videomixer' to mix subtitles & video? this should have less CPU
   usage and may help with slow network connections
 - useful statistics
 - get mouse / keyboard events, log them
 - OSD display (existing)
 - OSD display improved -- text backgrounds
 - python replacement to VideoWindow which runs process in the background
 - read from file (playback old) -- think about sync
