 * r1 bringup
   * 3.3v converter
   * 12v boost converter

DONE 2015-12-15
 * connect up herkulex protocol
 * no obvious low-hanging fruit for improving main loop speed
 * I2C "works" above 400kHz, but on discovery board, error rates are
   too high to be usable... this limits IMU to 800Hz.

DONE 2015-12-14
 * tview
   * real-time line plots of arbitrary values
   * plot on either left or right axis
   * copy paste values from the telemetry tree
 * initialize the AHRS with the accelerometer rather than making it
   slew there
 * would be nice to have a warning if the IMU isn't emitting data at
   the rate we expect
 * report current heap size in system_info
 * allow things which register with PersistentConfig to get notified
   when their config changes for explicit live updating
 * switch serial ports to put debugging on USB and herkulex on UART


DONE 2015-12-13
 * actually made I2C robust by getting bus reset procedure to work
 * tview

   * more appropriate default size for overall window, and for
     columns in tree view

DONE 2015-12-12
 * make I2C more robust... jiggle connections and ensure it keeps
   working, although it should log errors somehow
