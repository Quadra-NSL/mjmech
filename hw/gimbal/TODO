 * Software
   * read and write to the primary UART
   * get USB CDC device working

   * read and write anything from each I2C bus
   * read and write from the SPI bus
   * read from the ADC

   * get I2C DMA working
   * get SPI DMA working
   * get ADC DMA working
   * get PWM working

   * driver for BMI160
   * driver for AS5048
   * herkulex protocol
   * AHRS
   * gimbal control software
     * first, do a basic version just like the open-loop brugi
     * close loop using absolute encoders
     * add support for second IMU
   * get watchdog working


   * persistent configuration and protocol
   * error handling and reporting
   * live streaming of data structures for debugging over USB



 * BOM
   * power in + serial connector
   * +12V boost - TPS55330
   * down buck for uC - TPS62172 (3.3V)
   * yaw absolute encoder - AS5048B
   * connector for remote pitch absolute encoder (AS5048B)
   * connector for two BMI 160 IMUs
   * 2x DRV8313 BLDC drivers
   * 2x connectors for brushless motor
   * micro USB connector for diagnostics - 609-4618-1-ND
   * USB in connector
   * USB out connector for camera
   * programming connector
   * fire control
    * MC33926 Freescale
    * macrofab house mosfet for laser
   * processor STM32F411CEU6
   * some switch or button for arming?  maybe a soft switch?
   * indicator for armed
   * indicator for general power
   * indicator for status
   * indicator for serial comms

 * mounted on gimbal platform immediately above yaw motor
 * Make the yaw measurement actually compensated for pitch properly
   * only worth doing once I re-write it all to use quaternions
 * 3D printed gimbal is missing center holes for both the swivel hub
   and the gimbal motor
 * 3D printed gimbal is a little more flexible than is desired in
   several axes

DONE 2015-11-27
 * strip out C++ library stuff from image

DONE 2015-11-26
 * Got LED blinking on discovery board

DONE 2015-11-19
 * basic SCons build system in place

DONE 2015-11-16
 * macrofab order placed

DONE 2015-11-15
 * route larger width 3.3V supply around to where it is used
 * add decoupling caps for 3.3V supply on external I2C connectors
 * Route power
 * silks for signals on weap connector
 * autoroute remainder
 * fix up silks to not be on vias

DONE 2015-11-11

DONE 2015-11-09
 * Label all ICs and parts with useful names
 * Re-organized schematic... maybe it could be kind of considered
   organized now?
 * select all parts

DONE 2015-11-08
 * verified macrofab FET will work at 3.3V

 * make sure AS50448A has chip select line hooked up somewhere
   useful
 * do I need more ground vias under 12V boost regulator

DONE 2015-11-07
 * Initial work on board layout and schematic capture
 * Add switch for arming weapon
 * Added indicator LEDs
 * Update all resistors and caps to the MF passive library
