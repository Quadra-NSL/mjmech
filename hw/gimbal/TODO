 * TODO
   * verify package sizes and part values against part numbers
   * Clean up placement and ensure alignment where we can
   * Normalize fonts on silk screen
     * Remove values from silk screen
   * Add silk board description and labels
   * Route power
   * autoroute remainder

 * BOM
   * power in + serial connector
   * +12V boost - TPS55330
   * down buck for uC - TPS62172 (3.3V)
   * yaw absolute encoder - AS5048B
   * connector for remote pitch absolute encoder (AS5048B)
   * connector for two BMI 160 IMUs
   * 2x DRV8313 BLDC drivers
   * 2x connectors for brushless motor
   * micro USB connector for diagnostics - 609-4618-1-ND
   * USB in connector
   * USB out connector for camera
   * programming connector
   * fire control
    * MC33926 Freescale
    * macrofab house mosfet for laser
   * processor STM32F411CEU6
   * some switch or button for arming?  maybe a soft switch?
   * indicator for armed
   * indicator for general power
   * indicator for status
   * indicator for serial comms

 * mounted on gimbal platform immediately above yaw motor
 * Make the yaw measurement actually compensated for pitch properly
   * only worth doing once I re-write it all to use quaternions
 * 3D printed gimbal is missing center holes for both the swivel hub
   and the gimbal motor
 * 3D printed gimbal is a little more flexible than is desired in
   several axes

DONE 2015-11-09
 * Label all ICs and parts with useful names
 * Re-organized schematic... maybe it could be kind of considered
   organized now?
 * select all parts

DONE 2015-11-08
 * verified macrofab FET will work at 3.3V
 * add I2C pullup resistors (plan on high speed operation)
 * make sure AS50448A has chip select line hooked up somewhere
   useful
 * do I need more ground vias under 12V boost regulator

DONE 2015-11-07
 * Initial work on board layout and schematic capture
 * Add switch for arming weapon
 * Added indicator LEDs
 * Update all resistors and caps to the MF passive library
