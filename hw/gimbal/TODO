 * r1 defects
   * STM32 footprint is too small! :(
   * MOTOR1_EN and MOTOR2_EN aren't connected to anything!
   * BLDC_FAULT2 isn't connected to anything!
   * ARM switch selection (both digikey and MF), don't match footprint
   * USBO connector has correct DPN, but had wrong MPN transcribed to MF
   * some of the capacitors have silkscreens in the wrong place
     * C24/25 C22/23
   * right angle JST header has rear flanges that extend beyond its
     silkscreen
   * silk letter labels on weapon 8 pin connector don't match reality

   and the gimbal motor

   several axes

DONE 2015-12-19
 * r1 bringup
   * AS5048A
 * r2
   * switch TP names to be something usable
   * update weapon header silk labels
   * mounted in gimbal frame, works acceptably, although as expected
     the pitch down angle is limited by interference with the
     board... an updated bracket could put the entire weapon up a bit,
     which would remove this limitation.  As is, it can still probably
     look low enough to be workable.
