   * BOM
     * power in + serial connector
     * +12V boost - TPS55330
     * down buck for uC - TPS62172 (3.3V)
     * yaw absolute encoder - AS5048B
     * connector for remote pitch absolute encoder (AS5048B)
     * connector for two BMI 160 IMUs
     * 2x L6234PD BLDC drivers
     * 2x connectors for brushless motor
     * micro USB connector for diagnostics - 609-4618-1-ND
     * USB in connector
     * USB out connector for camera
     * programming connector
     * fire control
        * MC33926 Freescale
        * macrofab house mosfet for laser
     * processor STM32F411CEU6
     * some switch or button for arming?  maybe a soft switch?
     * indicator for armed
     * indicator for general power
     * indicator for status
     * indicator for serial comms

   * TODO
     * Add switch for arming weapon
     * Add indicator LEDs
     * maybe have way to adjust voltage on 12V rail?
     * Label all ICs and parts with useful names
     * Normalize fonts on silk screen
       * Remove values from silk screen
     * Route power

   * mounted on gimbal platform immediately above yaw motor
   * Make the yaw measurement actually compensated for pitch properly
     * only worth doing once I re-write it all to use quaternions
   * 3D printed gimbal is missing center holes for both the swivel hub
     and the gimbal motor
   * 3D printed gimbal is a little more flexible than is desired in
     several axes
