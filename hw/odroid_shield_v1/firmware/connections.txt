Serial mux:
  Two devices share serial port: servoes and AVR.
  Additionally, the serial interface on odroid uses bi-directional level
  converters which are picky about connected load (for example they need zero
  voltage to be very low)
  We use 7402 Quad-NOR chip to condition/mask signal. The pinout is:

             servo             AVR
        +5V  RXD  /---+---\  D2  D0
          |   |   |   |   |   |   |
      /--14--13--12--11--10---9---8---\
      |      4Y  4B  4A  3Y  3B  3A   |
      |<  7402 quad NOR               |
      |  2Y  2B  2A  1Y  1B  1A       |
      \---1---2---3---4---5---6---7---/
          |   |   |   |   |   |   |
              \+--+---/  TXD  |  GND
               |        servo |
             G-/     AVR      +----AVR D2
       BS170 D-----+-D1       |
      mosfet S-\   |          \--<R1>--+5V
               | <R2>
        GND----/   \-+5V   (R1,R2 = 4.7K)

  When avr in bootloader, D2 is tri-stated, and thus signals from/to servo are
  blocked. Once AVR is up, it tri-states TX and sets D2 low to connect servos
  directly to a serial port on odroid.
