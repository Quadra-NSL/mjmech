   * USB for peripherals - A type female 609-4413-ND
   * threaded fasteners for Joule module
     * I think PEM: SMTSO-M1.6-2ET is the right one, but will need to
       measure to be sure
   * mounting holes
   * fan power connector - a101008ct-nd
   * configuration eeprom - 497-11600-1-ND
   * I2C0 - VSYS converter and config eeprom
   * hdmi connector ? would need level converter and filters
   * buttons
     * power - MF-SW-TACT-6MM
     * boot from DNX - MF-SW-TACT-6MM
     * general purpose - MF-SW-TACT-6MM
   * indicator LEDs
     * main power
     * 4x GPIO w/ bipolar drivers MF-DSC-SOT233-MMBT3904

TODO
 * Schematic
   * figure out where USB power switch fault and enable line should go
   * Determine what to do with unused sdcard signals
     * cmd_dir
     * dat_dir
     * lvl_sel

 * Layout
   * esd diodes have a non-fixed width board font

 * Ensure there is sufficient room around mounting holes for screw
   heads
 * Does RTC battery holder schematic mark out how big a battery is?
 * Get DM3AT sample in house and verify footprint
   * ensure that we actually need no-route lines
   * figure out how to handle the shield... should it be connected to
     ground?
 * Get JST-ZH5 SMT VERT in house and verify footprint
 * Get 609-4413-ND and verify footprint
 * Figure out some way to buy SMTSO-M1.6's
 * Verify orientation and pinout of J6 and J7

 * Align all parts and silks

DONE 2016-11-11
 * Made primary mounting holes be an actual part instead of just a via
 * Ensure Joule mounting holes properly have no solder mask, but also
   no solder paste
 * Updated J6 and J7 to match picture of Joule's backside

DONE 2016-11-07
 * schematic for fan connector
