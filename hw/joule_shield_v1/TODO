Bring up Debugging ideas
 * In one trace, scope VSYS, VDD3, PMIC_PWRGOOD, and PMIC_RESET_N
 * Scope VSYS on both boards right at Joule module to see if there are
   obvious drops during bootup
 * Scope the ISH_GPIO_0-3 on both boards to see when/if they trigger
 * Scope eeprom I2C pins to see if it tries to talk to an EEPROM
 * (last ditch) remove SD card level translator


 * Initial part selection
   * 12V->VSYS converter - BQ25892
   * VSYS->5V converter - FAN48623
   * USB power switch - TPS2553DRVT
     * should work with 1.8V logic, no level converter needed for enable
   * level converter for serial to servos
     * 2x SN74LVC1T45DBVR - 296-16843-1-ND
   * connector to servos / gimbal drive board
     * JST XH 4 (DPN 455-2262-1-ND)
     * probably have gimbal drive board daisy chain power to compute
       board
   * SD card
     * level converter - SN74AVCA406L (only SD 2.0)
     * DM3AT-SF-PEJM5 HR1964CT-ND
   * RTC battery - BK-916-BT-ND
   * Fuse
     * reverse protection - B520C-FDICT-ND
     * F1400CT-ND
   * BIOS serial - FT231X 768-1128-1-ND
     * USB mini connector MF House part MF-CON-MICROUSB-RIGHT
     * should be able to do direct 1.8V interface without level conversion
   * USB for camera - 5 pin JST ZH  455-1696-1-ND
   * USB for peripherals - A type female 609-4413-ND
   * mounting holes
   * fan power connector - a101008ct-nd
   * I2C0 - VSYS converter and config eeprom
   * buttons
     * power - MF-SW-TACT-6MM
     * boot from DNX - MF-SW-TACT-6MM
     * general purpose - MF-SW-TACT-6MM
   * indicator LEDs
     * main power
     * 4x GPIO w/ bipolar drivers MF-DSC-SOT233-MMBT3904

r1 Errata

 * FB1-5 are C0603 on the board, but the part is 0402, need to
   reselect part number for 0603 bead
 * no ground test point
 * PMIC_PWR_GOOD has no test point
 * some SD card data lines are really long
 * Joule J7 pin 48 is undocumented, but grounded in the expansion board
 * lacking 0.1uF decoupling caps on vsys near joule connectors
 * ISH_GPIO_3 is documented as being tweaked by the BIOS during boot,
   it probably should be used to control power to one of the USB
   switches

TODO
 * Order

DONE 2017-05-29
 * Auto-route and arranged all silks

DONE 2017-05-27
 * Routed 5V regulator
 * Routed USB power switches

   3.6mm diameter, the existing via is 4mm diameter
 * Routed Joule power and ground
 * Routed power and ground for level converts, SD card, and debug USB
 * Routed all manual routes for everything

DONE 2017-05-26
 * Routed USB
 * Routed VSYS regulator

DONE 2017-05-24
 * lined up all physical mounting

DONE 2017-05-23
 * Verified pinouts on joule connector with Intel expansion board
 * Moved USB2 power switch under USB connector

DONE 2017-05-22
 * Reviewed expansion board design guide
 * Updated FT231X to have dual power from USB or from host
 * Verified FT231X won't drive the board if VCCIO is grounded

DONE 2017-05-20
 * Removed 1.8V and 3.3V regulators
 * Removed eeprom
 * Changed mounting solution to pass-through M1.6 screws with retaining nuts
 * Move buttons and LEDs so they won't be obstructed by camera cable
 * Get JST-ZH5 SMT RA in house and verify footprint
 * Give switches and LEDS meaningful names

DONE 2016-12-04
 * Get script to undo auto-route so I can save an auto-routed version

DONE 2016-12-01
 * Draw supply polys
 * connected up usb power switch and fault to GPIO pins
 * Verified footprint of 609-4413-ND
 * Ordered ZH5 RA connector to test footprint
 * Made a pass at aligning everything up

DONE 2016-11-30
 * Most of draft routing complete
 * Verify orientation and pinout of J6 and J7
 * Ensure there is sufficient room around mounting holes for screw
   heads
 * Switched to CR1225 RTC battery
 * Get DM3AT sample in house and verify footprint
   * ensure that we actually need no-route lines - yes, done
   * figure out how to handle the shield... should it be connected to
     ground?, decided to leave shield unconnected

DONE 2016-11-11
 * Made primary mounting holes be an actual part instead of just a via
 * Ensure Joule mounting holes properly have no solder mask, but also
   no solder paste
 * Updated J6 and J7 to match picture of Joule's backside
