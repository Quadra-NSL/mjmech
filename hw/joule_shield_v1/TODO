   * USB for peripherals - A type female 609-4413-ND
   * threaded fasteners for Joule module
     * I think PEM: SMTSO-M1.6-2ET is the right one, but will need to
       measure to be sure
   * mounting holes

TODO
 * Line up all physical mounting again
 * Route USB signals
 * Route power supply ground and powers
 * Route Joule ground and powers
 * Route ground and supply connections for everything else

 * DRC
 * Get test points for output of each of the voltage regulators
 * Clear all silks from vias
 * Verify pinouts on joule connector with Intel expansion board

DONE 2017-05-20
 * Removed 1.8V and 3.3V regulators
 * Removed eeprom
 * Changed mounting solution to pass-through M1.6 screws with retaining nuts
 * Move buttons and LEDs so they won't be obstructed by camera cable
 * Get JST-ZH5 SMT RA in house and verify footprint
 * Give switches and LEDS meaningful names

DONE 2016-12-04
 * Get script to undo auto-route so I can save an auto-routed version

DONE 2016-12-01
 * Draw supply polys
 * connected up usb power switch and fault to GPIO pins
 * Verified footprint of 609-4413-ND
 * Ordered ZH5 RA connector to test footprint
 * Made a pass at aligning everything up

DONE 2016-11-30
 * Most of draft routing complete
 * Verify orientation and pinout of J6 and J7
 * Ensure there is sufficient room around mounting holes for screw
   heads
 * Switched to CR1225 RTC battery
 * Get DM3AT sample in house and verify footprint
   * ensure that we actually need no-route lines - yes, done
   * figure out how to handle the shield... should it be connected to
     ground?, decided to leave shield unconnected

DONE 2016-11-11
 * Made primary mounting holes be an actual part instead of just a via
 * Ensure Joule mounting holes properly have no solder mask, but also
   no solder paste
 * Updated J6 and J7 to match picture of Joule's backside

DONE 2016-11-07
