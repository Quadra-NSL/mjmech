 * Initial part selection
   * 12V->VSYS converter - BQ25892
   * VSYS->5V converter - FAN48623
   * VSYS->3.3V converter - TPS63021
   * VSYS->1.8V converter - TLV62084
   * USB power switch - TPS2553DRVT
     * should work with 1.8V logic, no level converter needed for enable
   * level converter for serial to servos
     * 2x SN74LVC1T45DBVR - 296-16843-1-ND
   * connector to servos / gimbal drive board
     * 2x JST XH 4 (DPN 455-2261-1-ND)
     * probably have gimbal drive board daisy chain power to compute
       board
   * SD card
     * level converter - TXS0206-29 296-25577-1-ND (only works at SD2.0)
     * DM3AT-SF-PEJM5 HR1964CT-ND
   * RTC battery - BK-916-BT-ND
   * Fuse
     * reverse protection - B520C-FDICT-ND
     * F1400CT-ND
   * BIOS serial - FT231X 768-1128-1-ND
     * USB mini connector MF House part MF-CON-MICROUSB-RIGHT
     * should be able to do direct 1.8V interface without level conversion
   * USB for camera - 5 pin JST ZH  455-1684-1-ND
   * USB for peripherals - A type female 609-4413-ND
   * threaded fasteners for Joule module
     * I think PEM: SMTSO-M1.6-2ET is the right one, but will need to
       measure to be sure
   * mounting holes
   * fan power connector - a101008ct-nd
   * configuration eeprom - 497-11600-1-ND
   * I2C0 - VSYS converter and config eeprom
   * hdmi connector ? would need level converter and filters
   * buttons
     * power - MF-SW-TACT-6MM
     * boot from DNX - MF-SW-TACT-6MM
     * general purpose - MF-SW-TACT-6MM
   * indicator LEDs
     * main power
     * 4x GPIO w/ bipolar drivers MF-DSC-SOT233-MMBT3904

TODO
 * Schematic
   * figure out where USB power switch fault and enable line should go
   * fan connectors
   * SD card
   * RTC battery
   * BIOS serial connectors and USB-serial
   * buttons / LEDs

 * Footprints / Datasheets


 * Get DM3AT sample in house and verify footprint
   * ensure that we actually need no-route lines
 * Get JST-ZH5 SMT VERT in house and verify footprint
 * Get 609-4413-ND and verify footprint
 * Figure out some way to buy SMTSO-M1.6's
 * Verify orientation and pinout of J6 and J7
